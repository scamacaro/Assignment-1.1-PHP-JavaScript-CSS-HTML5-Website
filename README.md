# Assignment-1.1-PHP-JavaScript-CSS-HTML5-Website
Overview
For this assignment, you are starting a company that provides tours to Mars, but before you can take tourists on trips to Mars, you will need to hire pilots.

1. Choose a name for your company.

2. Make a static home page for your company with a .php extension. 

3. Write a short company description on your home page.

6. Create a JS file that is linked to from the form and that includes JavaScript validation.
